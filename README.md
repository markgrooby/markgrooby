- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there!

My name is Iâ€™m @markgrooby and I am a sales professional with a strong interest in Python and web application development.

I first became interested in Python while automating office tasks using python to query databases and excel sheets to build reports and dashboards . Since then, I have been learning as much as I can about the language and its various libraries and frameworks.

I am particularly interested in using Python for web development, and have experience building both simple and complex web applications using tools such as Django, Flask, and FastAPI. I also have experience with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and enjoy using these skills to create visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong problem solver and enjoy the process of analyzing a problem and coming up with creative solutions. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

Thank you for taking the time to read my profile. I am excited to contribute to open source projects and collaborate with other developers on GitHub.
